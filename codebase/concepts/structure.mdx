ProductStack comes as a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/), which is managed 
by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs). It combines shared packages, configuration, and 
user-facing applications in a single repository, hence the term monorepo. 

This structure is very common among startups, and big tech companies because it simplifies development, deployment, 
and maintenance.
