ProductStack comes as a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/), which is managed 
by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs). It combines shared packages, configuration, and 
user-facing applications in a single repository, hence the term monorepo. 

This structure is very common among startups, and big tech companies because it simplifies development, deployment, 
and maintenance.

<Info>
  If you are new to monorepos, don't worry! This documentation will guide you through the structure. 
  If you are interested in learning, here are some popular, open-source monorepos with a similar structure:
