## Overview

The database package is the layer that sits between the [core package](/core-concepts/core) and the database.
The technologies involved are:

- [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - The relational, SQL database
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) - The object-relational mapping (ORM) library
- [Neon](https://neon.tech/) - Managed database service

If you are using a local database in development, you also have:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Database container
- [OrbStack](https://www.orbstack.dev/) - Docker desktop alternative


## Structure

The database package is organized into the following directories:

- `client` - The database clients (local and production)
- `schema` - The Drizzle schema definitions
- `scripts` - Database scripts
- `utils` - Schema and query helper functions
- `migrations` - Database migrations (managed by Drizzle)

<Info>
  You will mostly interact with the `schema` directory, most features start by creating or updating schema files.

## Schema

The schema directory contains your [Drizzle schema](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql-schema-declaration) definitions, 
which define your database tables and the relationships between them.

You will notice that the schema directory structure is very similar to structyure of the core package. 
This is because the schema is the API of the database,
