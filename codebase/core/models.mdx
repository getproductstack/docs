In the [definitions](/concepts/core/definitions) section, we discussed how core resources have four primary representations:
database, business, insert, and update. Models are the business representations -- they include 
database attributes, computed attributes, helper methods, relationships to other resources, and anything else 
the business needs to properly represent the concept.

<Info>
In some cases, models serve the same purpose as [DTOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object), [View Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) 
and [Presenters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter), but they are more than that.

## Creating models

Models are created using factory functions that transform the database representation into the business representation. These 
functions are very simple and have the following signature:

```ts
type ModelFactory<TInput, TOutput> = (data: TInput) => TOutput;
```

### Examples

`createUserModel` is a simple example -- it has no relationships, and just a few additional attributes.

<CodeGroup>

```ts users/models.ts
import { initials } from "@repo/utils/string";
import { expandDate } from "@repo/utils/date";

import type { DatabaseUser } from "./definitions";

/**
 * Creates a user model.
 * 
 * @param user - The database user.
 * @returns The user model.
 */
export function createUserModel(user: DatabaseUser) {
  return {
    /**
     * The database user object.
     */
    ...user,
    /**
     * The username for display purposes.
     */
    username: user.name ?? user.email,
    /**
     * The user's initials, used the avatar components.
     */
    initials: initials(user.name ?? user.email),
    /**
     * Expanded date object.
     */
    createdAt: expandDate(user.createdAt),
  };
}
```

```ts users/definitions.ts
/**
 * The user model.
 */
export type UserModel = ReturnType<typeof createUserModel>;
```

</CodeGroup>

`createCommentModel` is a more complex example -- it has computed attributes, recursive relationships, and relationships that transform to other models.

<CodeGroup>

```ts comments/models.ts
import { expandDate } from "@repo/utils/date";

import { createUserActor } from "#core/accounts/users/models";
import { createAttachmentModel } from "../attachments/models";
import type { CommentModel, DatabaseComment } from "./definitions";

/**
 * Creates a comment model.
 * 
 * @param comment - The database comment.
 * @returns The comment model.
 */
export function createCommentModel(comment: DatabaseComment) {
  return {
    /**
     * The database comment object.
     */
    ...comment,
    /**
     * Expanded date object.
     */
    createdAt: expandDate(comment.createdAt),
    /**
     * The actor.
     */
    actor: comment.actor ? createUserActor(comment.actor) : null,
    /**
     * The attachments.
     */
    attachments: comment.attachments?.map(createAttachmentModel) ?? [],
    /**
     * The children.
     */
    children: comment.children?.map((child) => createCommentModel(child)) ?? [],
  };
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### When to use

Whenever you are working with a resource, you should almost always be using its model representation.
The exceptions are when you are interfacing with the database, either when creating or updating a resource.
In these cases, you should be using [validation schemas](/concepts/core/definitions#validation-schemas) and [database types](/concepts/core/definitions#type-definitions).

### How to use

The most common place you will use these model functions is in [queries](/concepts/core/queries). 
Most query functions chain a call to either `createModel` or `createModels`.

<CodeGroup>

```ts workspaces/queries.ts
const { createModel } = createModelFactories(createWorkspaceModel);

/**
 * Get a workspace by its ID.
 */
export async function workspaceById(id: string) {
  return db.query.workspaces
    .findFirst({ where: eq(workspaces.id, id) })
    .then(createModel);
}
```

```ts memberships/queries.ts
const { createModels } = createModelFactories(createMembershipModel);

/**
 * Get a user's memberships by their ID.
 */
export async function membershipsByUserId(userId: string) {
  return db.query.memberships
    .findMany({
      with: { workspace: true },
      where: eq(memberships.userId, userId),
    })
    .then(createModels);
}
```
</CodeGroup>

You may have noticed the `createModelFactories` function being used, this is just a convenience function 
that makes it easier chain calls like the above.

```ts base/models.ts
/**
 * Helper function for creating model factories.
 */
export function createModelFactories<TInput, TOutput>(
  factory: ModelFactory<TInput, TOutput>,
) {
  return {
    /**
     * Create a single model.
     */
    createModel: (data?: TInput) => (data ? factory(data) : null),

    /**
     * Create multiple models.
     */
    createModels: (data: TInput[]) => data.map((item) => factory(item)),
  };
}
```
