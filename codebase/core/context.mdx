Every request into your application has context, the state of the application during that request.
The `Context` object is a centralized way to access this 
application state from different parts of the system. 

The context is made up of the following:

- `Tenant`: current user, workspace, membership, role, and billing information
- `Actor`: the entity performing actions (`user`, `integration`, or `system`)
- `SessionModel`: the current user's session data
- `Gate`: tenant scoped authorization and access control
- `Events`: tenant scoped event dispatcher

## Accessing Context

When using [actions](/concepts/core/actions), the context is created automatically and made available to the action as a parameter.
You can also create the context manually by calling one of the `contextFrom` functions.

- `contextFromSession` - create the context from a `SessionModel`
- `contextFromTenant` - create the context from the current `Tenant`
- `contextFromMembership` - create the context from a `MembershipModel`
- `tenantFromToken` -> `contextFromTenant` - create the context from an `TokenModel`

<CodeGroup>

```ts SessionModel
/**
 * Create the context from the given `SessionModel`
 */
const context = contextFromSession(session);
```

```ts MembershipModel
/**
 * Create the context from the given `MembershipModel`
 */ 
const context = contextFromMembership(membership);
```

```ts TokenModel
/**
 * Create the context from the given `TokenModel`
 */
const tenant = tenantFromToken(token);
const context = contextFromTenant(tenant);
```

```ts Tenant
/**
 * Create the context from the current `Tenant`
 */
const context = contextFromTenant(tenant);
```
