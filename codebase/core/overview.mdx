Perhaps the most important part of your codebase, `packages/core` is the foundation upon which 
everything else is built. Specifically, it represents the business concepts -- the 
framework-agnostic building blocks -- that make up your product.

<Note>
  When discussing the core package, we use the term "resource" to refer to business or product concepts.
  You may also see this term referred to as a "concept".

## Naming conventions

The core package has strong conventions, with each resource being structured the same way and each 
file containing the same exports. This consistency makes it easy to understand and navigate, 
while also making it easier to [generate resources](/digging-deeper/codegen) programatically.

Here are a few snippets of this naming convention in practice:

<CodeGroup>

```ts workspaces/definitions.ts
export type WorkspaceModel = ReturnType<typeof createWorkspaceModel>;
export type DatabaseWorkspace = typeof workspaces.$inferSelect;

export const insertWorkspaceSchema = createInsertSchema(workspaces);
export type InsertDatabaseWorkspace = z.infer<typeof insertWorkspaceSchema>;
```

```ts memberships/definitions.ts
export type MembershipModel = ReturnType<typeof createMembershipModel>;
export type DatabaseMembership = typeof memberships.$inferSelect;

export const insertMembershipSchema = createInsertSchema(memberships);
export type InsertDatabaseMembership = z.infer<typeof insertMembershipSchema>;
```

</CodeGroup>

Obviously, not every file is required and you are free to add additional files and exports as needed, 
but following this general structure is highly recommended.

## Directory structure

Within each concept directory, you may see the following:

- [`definitions.ts`](/concepts/core/definitions) - schemas, constants, validations and types
- [`models.ts`](/concepts/core/models) - data models
- [`queries.ts`](/concepts/core/queries) - data fetching functions
- [`events.ts`](/concepts/core/events) - event definitions and subscribers
- [`mutations.ts`](/concepts/core/mutations) - data modification functions
- [`jobs.ts`](/concepts/core/jobs) - background, queued and scheduled jobs
- [`notifications.ts`](/concepts/core/notifications) - notification definitions
