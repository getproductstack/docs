Mutations are functions that modify data, most commonly used to create, update, and delete resources.

Here are a few examples:

<CodeGroup>

```ts invitations/mutations.ts
/**
 * Create an invitation.
 */
export async function createInvitation({
  ctx,
  input,
}: Action<InsertDatabaseInvitation>) {
  ctx.gate.authorize("create.memberships");

  const [invite] = await db
    .insert(invitations)
    .values({
      email: input.email,
      invitedById: ctx.tenant.userId,
      workspaceId: ctx.tenant.workspaceId,
    })
    .returning();

  if (!invite) {
    throw new Error("Failed to create invitation");
  }

  ctx.events.emit("invitation.created", created);

  return created;
}

```

```ts activity/mutations.ts
/**
 * Update a activity.
 */
export async function updateActivity({
  ctx,
  input,
}: Action<UpdateDatabaseActivity>) {
  ctx.gate.authorize("update.activities");

  const [updated] = await db
    .update(activities)
    .set(input.changes)
    .where(
      and(
        eq(activities.id, input.id),
        eq(activities.workspaceId, ctx.tenant.workspaceId),
      ),
    )
    .returning();

  if (!updated) {
    throw new Error("Failed to update activity");
  }

  ctx.events.emit("activity.updated", input);

  return updated;
}

```

## Anatomy

If you look at the examples above, you'll notice they have a similar structure, they all:

- accept [Context](/concepts/core/context) and input parameters
- authorize the operation being performed
- perform the necessary operation(s)
- emit an event if the operation was successful
- return a response

Let's take a look at some of these in more detail.

### Parameters

Most mutations use the `Action` type in their signature, which provides `ctx` ([Context](/concepts/core/context)) 
and `input` objects.
 
```ts
export type Action<TInput = unknown> = {
  ctx: Context;
  input: TInput;
};
```

Of course, you are free to define mutations without these parameters, but it makes using them
with [actions](/concepts/core/actions) a little more verbose.

### Authorization

Before any operation logic, mutations should [authorize](/concepts/core/auth#authorization) 
the actor to ensure they have the necessary permissions.

The primary way to perform these authorization checks is to use the tenant-aware `gate`
on the `ctx` object.

```ts
/**
 * Authorize the user to create a membership.
 */
ctx.gate.authorize("create.memberships");

/**
 * Authorize the user to update an activity.
 */
ctx.gate.authorize("update.activities");
```

You can learn more about gates, and authorization in general, in the [auth section](/concepts/core/auth#authorization).

### Emitting events

If the mutation modifies a resource in any way, it should send a notification to
the rest of the system by emitting an event.

You do this by calling `ctx.events.emit` with the event name and the payload of the resource that was modified.

```ts
/**
 * Emit an event when an invitation is created.
 */
ctx.events.emit("invitation.created", created);

/**
 * Emit an event when an activity is updated.
 */
ctx.events.emit("activity.updated", input);
```

By emitting an event, other parts of the system that are interested in the modified resource can
react to the change.

You can learn more about events and subscribing to them in the [events section](/concepts/core/events).

## Where to use

It is most common for mutations to be used within [actions](/concepts/core/actions), where they can group together
related operations, but you are free to use them wherever you see fit.
