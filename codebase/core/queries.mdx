Queries are functions that fetch data from external sources -- mostly the database, but also third-party services, the file system, and more.

Here are a few common examples:

<CodeGroup>

```ts memberships/queries.ts
const { createModel, createModels } = createModelFactories(
  createMembershipModel,
);

/**
 * Get a membership by ID.
 */
export async function membershipById(membershipId: string) {
  return db.query.memberships
    .findFirst({
      with: { 
        user: true,
        workspace: true
      },
      where: eq(memberships.id, membershipId),
    })
    .then(createModel);
}

/**
 * Get the user's memberships.
 */
export async function membershipsByUserId(userId: string) {
  return db.query.memberships
    .findMany({
      with: { 
        workspace: true 
      },
      where: eq(memberships.userId, userId),
    })
    .then(createModels);
}
```

```ts location/queries.ts
/**
 * Get an array of countries.
 */
export async function getCountries() {
  return [
    {
      iso: "AD",
      name: "Andorra",
      unicode: "U+1F1E6 U+1F1E9",
      flag: "ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡©",
    },
    {
      iso: "AE",
      name: "United Arab Emirates",
      unicode: "U+1F1E6 U+1F1EA",
      flag: "ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ª",
    },
    // ...
  ];
}
```

## Writing queries

Most queries are database queries, so understanding Drizzle's [query builder](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/rqb) 
and [SQL syntax](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/select) gets you most of the way there. There are, however, a few 
general rules that you should follow when writing queries:

- function names start with the resource name: `membership`ById
- function names include query parameters: user`ById`, members`ByWorkspaceId`
- accept only the parameters required for the query, no context objects
- database queries should always return a single model or a collection of models
- use consistent, shared pagination, filter and sorting logic
- use custom transformations when needed, but avoid them when possible
- do not export the query if it is not used outside the file

## Where to use

Simply put, queries are used wherever you need to access the data they return, most commonly from the following places:

- other queries
- mutations
- server actions
- tRPC procedures
