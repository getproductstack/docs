Jobs are a way to perform operations outside of the normal request-response lifecycle. This includes
background jobs, scheduled jobs (cron jobs), job workflows, and job queues.

Here is an example of dispatching a job that sends a workspace invitation email:

```ts
import { sendInvitationJob } from "#core/accounts/invitations/jobs";

await sendInvitationJob.dispatch(
  { email: "test@example.com" }
);
```

There are many reasons to use jobs, but the most common are:

- To avoid blocking the response and improve perceived performance
- To control execution order and concurrency
- To scale independently from the main request handlers

Common job use cases include:

- Sending emails
- Processing payments
- Generating reports
- Refreshing caches
- Triggering notifications
- Running workflows

## Infrastructure

In serverless environments, jobs are infrastructure-specific, and ProductStack provides
implementations using Upstash [QStash](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash) and
[Workflows](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/workflow/getstarted)

The rest of this guide will assume you are using these implementations.

## Creating jobs

Jobs are created using the `createJob` factory function provided by `packages/queue`. Here is an example:

```ts 
import { channels, templates } from "@repo/notification";
import { createJob } from "@repo/queue";
import { appConfig } from "@repo/utils/config";
import { url } from "@repo/utils/request";

import type { InvitationModel } from "./definitions";

/**
 * Send an invitation email.
 */
export const sendInvitationJob = createJob(
  { key: "send-invitation-email" },
  async ({ email, workspace, invitedBy, token }: InvitationModel) => {
    if (!workspace) {
      throw new Error("Invitation does not have a workspace");
    }

    await channels.resend.send({
      to: email,
      subject: `Join ${workspace.name} on ${appConfig.name}`,
      html: templates.workspaceInvitation({
        link: url(`join/${token}`, { email }).toString(),
        workspaceName: workspace.name,
        invitedByName: invitedBy?.name ?? null,
      }),
    });
  },
);
```

Jobs are functions that take two arguments:

1. A job definition object
2. A function that takes a single argument, the job payload

## Executing jobs

Once created, jobs can be exported/imported, and "executed" in a number of ways:

- Asynchronously using `dispatch`
- Synchronously using `trigger`
- On a schedule using `schedule`
- In a queue using `queue`

### Dispatch

Sticking with our example, `sendInvitationJob` can be executed as a background job using the `dispatch`
method.

```ts
import { sendInvitationJob } from "#core/accounts/invitations/jobs";

await sendInvitationJob.dispatch(
  { email: "test@example.com" }
);
```

### Trigger

Jobs can be executed synchronously, like any other function, which is useful for testing and development.

```ts
import { sendInvitationJob } from "#core/accounts/invitations/jobs";

await sendInvitationJob.trigger(
  { email: "test@example.com" }
);
```

<Note>
The `dispatch` method will automatically use `trigger` when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `development`.
</Note>

### Schedule

In order to schedule a job, call `schedule` and provide a cron expression.

```ts
import { sendInvitationJob } from "#core/accounts/invitations/jobs";

await sendInvitationJob.schedule(
  { email: "test@example.com" },
  { schedule: "* * * * *" },
);
```

You can learn more about scheduling on the [Upstash documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/features/schedules).

### Queue

To queue a job, call the `queue` method and provide the queue name:

```ts
import { sendInvitationJob } from "#core/accounts/invitations/jobs";

await sendInvitationJob.queue(
  { email: "test@example.com" },
  { queue: "invitations" },
);
```

You can learn more about queuing on the [Upstash documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/features/queues).

### Delays

Jobs can be delayed by providing a delay option to the `dispatch` and `queue` methods.

```ts
// Delay for 10 seconds
await sendInvitationJob.dispatch(
  { email: "test@example.com" },
  { delay: 10000 },
);
```
