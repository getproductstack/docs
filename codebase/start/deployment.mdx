Continuous deployment and continuous development are core principles of building great software.
You should be deploying changes frequently -- to production -- so let's get your first
deployment out of the way.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. A [GitHub repository](https://github.com/new) with the codebase
2. A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com)
3. Third-party providers that you intend to use (see below)

## Providers

ProductStack leverages a few third-party services to provide important product functionality. 
It is **highly recommended** that you set these up before proceeding. The following is 
a list of all providers, their purpose, and how to set them up.

A few important notes on third-party providers:

- **Free tiers**: every service has a free tier that covers enough development, and some production workloads.
- **Adapter-based**: provider functionality is adapter-based, designed to easily switch between underlying services.
- **Documentation**: below is the provider set up documentation, functionality documentation can be found in corresponding sections.

## Deploying

These steps are for deploying the product application, you can use the same process for deploying the API application.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Vercel Project">
    Go to your [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com) and click **Add New >
    Project**. Click **Import** next to your repository.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Project">
    Give your project name, make sure `Next.js` is selected as the framework
    and change the root directory to `apps/app`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Environment Variables">
    Set the following environment variables. If you haven't set up the services
    yet, follow the [services](/start/services) documentation to get
    the values you need.

    ```bash
# Databases
DATABASE_URL=""
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=""
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=""

# Email
RESEND_API_KEY=""

# Realtime
ABLY_API_KEY=""

# File Storage
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=""

# Notifications
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=""
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=""
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=""
