ProductStack relies on a few specific third-party services to provide important product and developer 
functionality. It is **highly recommended** that you set these services up before proceeding with the rest of 
this documentation.

<Note>
  Every service ProductStack uses has a free tier that is more than enough for development, preview, and even some production workloads.
</Note>

## List of services

Below is a list of all services, their purpose, and how to set them up.
You may see these instructions in other parts of the documentation but you can always
refer back here for a complete list.
