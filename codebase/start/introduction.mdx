## What is ProductStack?

ProductStack is decades of experience, technical decisions, and best practices distilled into a single codebase.
It is specifically designed for creating products that customers love and developers love to build.

Beyond the code, ProductStack is an education in building modern software. It was created 
by founders who have built billion dollar startups and bootstrapped companies alike.
