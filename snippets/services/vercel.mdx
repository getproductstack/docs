Vercel is used for deployments and file uploads. You can also use Vercel
for the database (through the Neon integration) and Redis (through the Upstash integration)

**File uploads**

2. Go to the **Storage** tab and `Create` a new **Blob** storage.
3. Under **Quickstart**, click the **.env.local** tab, copy the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` and set the following environment variables:

```bash
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=<your-token>
```
