Add GitHub as an authentication provider. This allows customers to "Sign in w/ GitHub".

1. Create a new [GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/apps) under your organization account (or personal account if you want).
2. Enter a name, homepage URL, and set the callback URL to `https://localhost:3000/login/oauth/github/callback`.
3. Check `Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation`.
4. Under **Permissions** > **Account permissions** > \*\*Email addresses`, check `Read-only`.
5. Under **Where can this GitHub App be installed?**, select `Any account`.
6. Copy the `Client ID`, generate a new `Client Secret` and set the following environment variables:

```bash
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret>
```
