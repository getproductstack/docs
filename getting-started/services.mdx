## Overview

Your codebase integrates with several third-party services, some requried and some optional, to
provide important product functionality. It's **highly recommended** that you set up all the services
before proceeding with the rest of this documentation.

<Warning>
  Every service has a free tier, you will only have to pay once you exceed the
  free tier limits, ideally once you start generating revenue.
</Warning>

## Services

Below is a list of all integrated services, their purpose, and how to set them up.
You may see these instructions in other parts of the documentation but you can always
refer back here for a complete list.
