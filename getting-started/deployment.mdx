One of the core ProductStack principles is continuous development and deployment.
You should be deploying changes frequently, to production, so let's get your first
one out of the way.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="GitHub repository">
    GitHub is used for hosting the repository. If you haven't already, [create a
    new repository](https://github.com/new) and push up the code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Vercel account">
    Vercel is used for preview and production deployments. If you don't already
    have an account, head to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and create one.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Third-party services">
    You should have set up all of the [services](/getting-started/services) that you intend to use.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup> 

## Deploying
