## Overview

ProductStack is a monorepo managed by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs). It combines shared packages, configuration, and 
user-facing applications in a single repository. This structure is very
common among newer product companies as it promotes reusability, modularity, and scalability.

<Info>
  If you are new to monorepos, don't worry! The structure is designed to be intuitive and
  easy to understand. If you are interested in learning, here are some popular, open-source 
  monorepos with a similar structure:

  - [Cal.com](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)
  - [Midday](https://github.com/midday-ai/midday)
  - [Dub](https://github.com/dubinc/dub)

## Directory Structure

There are four main top-level directories

- [apps](#apps)
- [packages](#packages)
- [config](#config)
