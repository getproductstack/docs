## Overview

The core package is by far and away the most important part of your codebase, it's the foundation 
that everything else is built upon. Specifically, it represents the important business concepts found 
within your product.

## Naming Conventions

The core package has strong naming conventions, each resource is structured the same way and each 
file contains the same exports. This consistency makes it easier to understand and navigate the codebase, 
as well as [generate code](/digging-deeper/codegen) programatically.

<CodeGroup>

```ts workspaces/definitions.ts
export type WorkspaceModel = ReturnType<typeof createWorkspaceModel>;
export type DatabaseWorkspace = typeof workspaces.$inferSelect;

export const insertWorkspaceSchema = createInsertSchema(workspaces);
export type InsertDatabaseWorkspace = z.infer<typeof insertWorkspaceSchema>;
```

```ts memberships/definitions.ts
export type MembershipModel = ReturnType<typeof createMembershipModel>;
export type DatabaseMembership = typeof memberships.$inferSelect;

export const insertMembershipSchema = createInsertSchema(memberships);
export type InsertDatabaseMembership = z.infer<typeof insertMembershipSchema>;
```

</CodeGroup>

Obviously, not every file is required and you are free to add additional files and exports as needed, 
but following this general structure is highly recommended.

## Directory Structure

Within each concept directory, you may see the following:

- [`definitions.ts`](/concepts/core/definitions) - schemas, constants, validations and types
- [`models.ts`](/concepts/core/models) - data models
- [`queries.ts`](/concepts/core/queries) - data fetching functions
- [`events.ts`](/concepts/core/events) - event definitions and subscribers
- [`mutations.ts`](/concepts/core/mutations) - data modification functions
- [`jobs.ts`](/concepts/core/jobs) - background, queued and scheduled jobs
- [`notifications.ts`](/concepts/core/notifications) - notification definitions
